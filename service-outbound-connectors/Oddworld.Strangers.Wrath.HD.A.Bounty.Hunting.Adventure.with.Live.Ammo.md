The game features a unique mechanic of using live creatures as ammo for the Stranger's double-barreled crossbow. These critters have different effects on enemies, such as distracting them, stunning them, exploding on them, or even possessing them. The player can switch between different ammo types on the fly and combine them for more powerful attacks. The game also allows the player to choose between lethal and non-lethal methods of capturing bounties, which affects the rewards and the reputation of the Stranger.
 
Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD boasts improved graphics, sound, and controls for the PC version. It also includes some hidden Easter eggs and 35 achievements to unlock. The game has received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, praising its originality, humor, story, and gameplay. The game is available on Steam[^1^] and GOG[^2^] for $9.99 USD.

The game also features a rich and colorful Oddworld universe, with quirky characters, diverse environments, and a distinctive art style. The game's HD version enhances the visuals with higher resolution textures, more detailed models, and dynamic shadows. The game also supports widescreen and 60 FPS modes, as well as controller support and achievements. The game's soundtrack and voice acting are also well done, adding to the atmosphere and humor of the game.
 
Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD is not without its flaws, however. Some of the game's design choices and difficulty spikes can be frustrating or tedious, such as the limited inventory space, the lack of checkpoints, the unbalanced enemies, and the trial-and-error sections. The game's controls can also feel clunky or imprecise at times, especially in third-person mode. The game's performance on the Switch is also not optimal, with some noticeable frame drops, pop-in, and glitches. The game's UI and text are also too small for handheld mode.
 
Overall, Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD is a game that still holds up well today, thanks to its originality, humor, story, and gameplay. It is a game that deserves to be played by fans of action-adventure games and Oddworld enthusiasts alike. It may not be perfect, but it is certainly unique and memorable.

If you are interested in playing Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD, here are some tips that might help you get started:
 
- Experiment with different ammo types. The game offers a variety of living ammo that have different effects on enemies and the environment. Some ammo can be used to lure, stun, trap, or damage enemies, while others can be used to interact with objects or solve puzzles. Try to find the best ammo for each situation and don't be afraid to mix and match them for more creative results.
- Use stealth and melee when possible. While shooting is fun and effective, it can also alert nearby enemies and make things harder for you. Sometimes, it is better to sneak up on enemies and knock them out with your fists or your crossbow. This can save you ammo and health, as well as earn you more money for capturing bounties alive.
- Explore the world and talk to NPCs. The game has a lot of hidden secrets and collectibles that can enhance your experience and reward you with extra money or health upgrades. You can also learn more about the Oddworld lore and characters by talking to the friendly NPCs you encounter. They might also give you hints or side quests that can help you progress.
- Manage your inventory and health wisely. The game has a limited inventory space for your ammo and health items, so you have to be careful not to waste them or leave them behind. You can also sell your excess items at vending machines or buy new ones if you need them. You can also heal yourself by shaking off the damage or using health packs, but be aware that this will lower your stamina meter temporarily.
- Save often and adjust the difficulty if needed. The game can be quite challenging at times, especially in some boss fights or platforming sections. The game does not have an autosave feature, so you have to manually save at designated save points or at the start of each area. You can also change the difficulty level at any time if you find the game too easy or too hard.
